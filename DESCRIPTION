Description: Set operations for many sets. The base functions for set operations
    in R can be used for only two sets. This package uses 'purr' to find the
    union, intersection and difference of three or more sets. This package also
    provides functions for pairwise set operations among several sets. Further, 
    based on 'ggplot2' and 'ggforce', a Venn diagram can be drawn for two or 
    three sets. For bigger data sets, a clustered heatmap showing presence/absence 
    of the elements of the sets can be drawn based on the 'pheatmap' package. 
    Finally, enrichment test can be applied to two sets whether an overlap is 
    statistically significant or not.
